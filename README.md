Project title: Movie Fun

Team Members: Shawn Williams, Mark Williams, Randy Treat

Project Description: Correlate movies rating with year, director, run time and ratings from rotten tomatoes, Metacritic and imbd

Research Questions: 

  When using the website Random Lists and accessing the random movie generator what kind and how good are the movies?

  What genres of movies do you get?

  Who are the directors and are they "good"? Do you get "good" movies based on rotten tomatoes, Metacritic and imbd?

  From what time period (by year) do the movies come form? Are they new, classic or a good mix?

  Datasets to be used: http://www.omdbapi.com, movies titles pulled from: https://www.randomlists.com/random-movies

Rough breakdown of tasks: pass around with writing code
